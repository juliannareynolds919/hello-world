Hi! My name is Julianna and live in Nashua, NH! I work for the USGS as a hydrologica technician, collectingh stream discharge data for the state of Massachusetts. I've been there since April 2022 and really hope that I can continue to work there for years to come! I started my graduate journey in the winter of 2024, when I decided I needed a switch. Here's to hoping a career centered around GIS is in my cards (I currently work part-time with our Data Analytics and Visualization section working on GIS projects)!

In my free time, I am an intern working on the Arizona Tri-University Recharge (ATUR) Project, analyzing the current state of Green Stormwater Infrastrucutre (which is turning into my capstone project, so awesome). I enjoy watching reality TV to decompress; hiking (all seasons) and camping (not all seasons); reading (currently taking two years to finish the Dark Tower series by Stephen King, longest it's ever taken me to read anything in my life); and trying new restaurants in New England.

I look forward to learning more in this class!
